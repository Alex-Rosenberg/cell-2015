###Code From the *Learning the Sequence Determinants of Alternative Splicing from Millions of Random Sequences*

In an effort to make my results reproducible and aid others in their own data analysis, I've included all of the code used in the paper. I hope this will be useful and feel free to conact me with suggestions/comments/questions. Happy data mining!
